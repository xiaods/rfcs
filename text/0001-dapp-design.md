# Summary
ComUnion Dapp design architecture

# Motivation

ComUnion is DAO Decentralized organization Registration Service provider. we
beleive new work rules on new 2050 peoples. so we plan to provide DApp to serve
our users.

# Guide-level explanation
use imtoken DApp feature to empower our Dapp interface. it can invoke imtoken's
web3 functional feature to interactive with ethereum node.

also we need use domain name to explorer web3's resource. Currently the
Ethereum provide ENS service to resolve 40 bit hash address.


# Reference-level explanation
- [imtoken DApp SDK](https://docs.token.im/dapp-sdk/)
- [Alibaba LUXE domain name](https://www.alibabacloud.com/zh/domain/luxe)

# Drawbacks
- we are decentralized organization self. we don't use center service to
  provide our core values.
- don't reinvent wheel for degital wallet. please use imtoken e.g. So our
  feataures depends on wallet's sdk.

# Rationale and alternatives
